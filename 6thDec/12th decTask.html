            <td style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"> Bootstrap makes responsive web design a reality. It makes it possible for a web page or app to detect the visitor's screen size and orientation and automatically adapt the display accordingly.<br></br>The mobile-first approach assumes smartphones, tablets and task-specific mobile apps are employees' primary tools for getting work done. Bootstrap addresses the requirements of those technologies in design and includes UI components, layouts, JavaScript tools and the implementation framework.The software is available precompiled or as source code.</td>
            <td style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"> In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, form the application’s entire user interface.<br></br.>React’s primary role in an application is to handle the view layer of that application just like the V in a model-view-controller (MVC) pattern by providing the best and most efficient rendering execution. Rather than dealing with the whole user interface as a single unit.</td>
            <td style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"> From the beginning to the end, a development project is in the hands of a full-stack developer. Professionals are well-versed in the ins and outs of various environments and integrations, as well as the various frameworks, libraries, and tools that go into building a successful app or website.<br><br>As a result, full-stack developers are familiar with the frontend as well as the backend of a website’s technology. What’s more is that they are well-versed in server, network, and hosting settings, as well as frontend and backend languages and frameworks. </td>
